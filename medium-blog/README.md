## Functional clone of Medium.com

This project was part of the 100xDevs cohort, taught by Harkirat Singh.

However, there are multiple feautures and improvements that were not part of the original version, which I implemented to make the application more useful. Here are some of the features that I added:
- UI: Made use of several tailwind components. Added loaders for seamless transitions.
- Author bio: Implemented the author bio feature to the right of the blog's content. Made several changes to the postgres schema to implement this feature.
- User profile: Implemented a user profile page where users can edit their username, password and bio. Again, added a new postgres schema to implement this feature.
- Profile pictures: Implemented profile pictures that users could upload and edit in the user profile page. This feature is currently disabled since I was unable to store all the images locally.
- Edit and delete post: These features were part of the original but were left as assignments.
- Cover images: Implemented cover images for every blog. The author needs to paste the link to the image. Cover images are also present on the home page beside the title and description of the blog.
