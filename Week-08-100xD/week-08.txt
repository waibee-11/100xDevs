IMPORTANT CONCEPTS TO KNOW WHEN SWITCHING FROM ONE CSS FRAMEWORK TO ANOTHER:
- Flex
- Grids
- Responsiveness
- Standard styling

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TAILWIND:
- It is a popular CSS framework that uses classes instead of raw CSS code.
- For installation process, follow the docs on tailwind's website.
- For commands, again the docs are the best place.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

RESPONSIVENESS IN TAILWIND:
- Tailwind comes with a lot of breakpoints like sm, md, lg, xl, xxl
- Use these breakpoints before a classname to conditionally render them based on the screen size
- Tailwind is a mobile first framework. Unprefixed utilities will be applied for all sizes, and prefixed utilities will
be applied for that size and above.
- Eg: sm:text-center will center the text for sm and above (and not below as you might think)
