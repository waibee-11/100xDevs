<!-- However, we now want to add some functionality to the
page. We want to display the sum of the 2 numbers below.
We need the DOM (Document Object Model) for creating this
dynamic frontend. -->
<!-- We add an empty div element with id 'final-sum'. We create
a function populateDiv() in script.js and give it as the onclick
function to the button. -->
<!-- We use .getElementById and .InnerHTML to get elements,
their inner value and set the sum as the value of 'final-sum' -->
<!-- This was the method of creating dynamic websites decades ago.
Now, however we use React, which makes it very easy. -->

<!-- Now, we want to do the same thing, but via a request to
the backend. Essentially, we cannot do the addition locally
but send it to a backend and get back the response. -->
